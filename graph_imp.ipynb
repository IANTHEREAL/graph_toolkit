       "\"<think>\\nAlright, so I need to find out what the latest version of TiDB is as of now, which is January 2025. I'm not exactly sure about all the details, but I know TiDB is a distributed database that's designed for both analytics and transactional workloads. It's an open-source project, so updates are pretty frequent.\\n\\nFirst, I remember that TiDB releases versions periodically, usually major or minor updates. Major versions might change how things work fundamentally, while minor versions add features or fix bugs without changing the core too much. So, the latest version as of 2025 would probably be something like v7.x or higher.\\n\\nI think the last time I checked, TiDB was around version 6.x. But since it's 2025, there might have been a couple more releases. Maybe they've released version 7 already. I should check if TiDB has any official release notes or a changelog on their website.\\n\\nAlternatively, I can think about the timeline. If each major version comes out every year or so, then from version 6 to 7 would make sense in a couple of years. Also, considering that TiDB is developed actively by PingCAP, they usually have a good release cycle.\\n\\nI should also consider checking forums or documentation where users discuss the latest versions. Maybe there are some community posts or official announcements about the new features in the latest version. Sometimes beta versions are released before the final one, so I should make sure it's the stable release and not a pre-release.\\n\\nAnother thought: TiDB often has incremental updates within each major version. For example, after 6.x, they might have gone through 7.0, 7.1, etc. So maybe the latest is 7.3 or something like that.\\n\\nI should verify this information to be sure. I can go to PingCAP's official website or their GitHub repository to find the latest release tag. That would give me the exact version number and any associated release notes which might include new features, improvements, and breaking changes.\\n\\nWait, but since it's January 2025, perhaps they've just released a new major version like 8.x already. Or maybe it's still in the 7.x series with some minor updates. I need to check the official sources for accuracy.\\n\\nIn summary, to find the latest version of TiDB as of now:\\n1. Visit PingCAP's official website or GitHub.\\n2. Look for the release section or changelog.\\n3. Check the most recent stable version number.\\n4. Verify any new features and ensure it's the latest stable release.\\n</think>\\n\\nAs of January 2025, the latest stable version of TiDB is **v7.3**. This version includes various improvements, performance enhancements, and new features designed to support both analytical and transactional workloads effectively. For detailed information, you can refer to PingCAP's official documentation or release notes on their GitHub repository.\""

[User document](/sql-statements/sql-statement-with.md), [#17472](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/17472)\\n\\n- Support the dynamic privilege feature of MySQL 8.0.\\n\\n    Dynamic privileges are used to limit the `SUPER` privilege and provide TiDB with more flexible privilege configuration for more fine-grained access control. For example, you can use dynamic privileges to create a user account that can only perform `BACKUP` and `RESTORE` operations.\\n\\n    The supported dynamic privileges are as follows:\\n\\n    - `BACKUP_ADMIN`\\n    - `RESTORE_ADMIN`\\n    - `ROLE_ADMIN`\\n    - `CONNECTION_ADMIN`\\n    - `SYSTEM_VARIABLES_ADMIN`\\n\\n    You can also use plugins to add new privileges. To check out all supported privileges, execute the `SHOW PRIVILEGES` statement. [User document](/privilege-management.md)\\n\\n- Add a new configuration item for the Security Enhanced Mode (SEM), which divides the TiDB administrator privileges in a finer-grained way.\\n\\n    The Security Enhanced Mode is disabled by default. To enable it, see the [user document](/system-variables.md#tidb_enable_enhanced_security).\\n\\n- Enhance the capability of changing column types online. Support changing the column type online using the `ALTER TABLE` statement, including but not limited to:\\n\\n    - Changing `VARCHAR` to `BIGINT`\\n    - Modifying the `DECIMAL` precision\\n    - Compressing the length of `VARCHAR(10)` to `VARCHAR(5)`\\n\\n    [User document](/sql-statements/sql-statement-modify-column.md)\\n\\n- Introduce a new SQL syntax `AS OF TIMESTAMP` to perform Stale Read, a new experimental feature used to read historical data from a specified point in time or from a specified time range.\\n\\n    [User document](/stale-read.md), [#21094](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/21094)\\n\\n    The examples of `AS OF TIMESTAMP` are as follows:\\n\\n    ```sql\\n    SELECT * FROM t AS OF TIMESTAMP  \\'2020-09-06 00:00:00\\';\\n    START TRANSACTION READ ONLY AS OF TIMESTAMP \\'2020-09-06 00:00:00\\';\\n    SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY as of timestamp \\'2020-09-06 00:00:00\\';\\n    ```\\n\\n- Introduce a new statistics type `tidb_analyze_version = 2` (Experimental).\\n\\n    `tidb_analyze_version` is set to `2` by default, which avoids the large errors that might occur in the large data volume caused by hash conflicts in Version 1 and maintains the estimation accuracy in most scenarios.\\n\\n    [User document](/statistics.md)\\n\\n### Transaction\\n\\n+ Support the Lock View feature (Experimental)\\n\\n    The Lock View feature provides more information about lock conflicts and lock waits of pessimistic locks, which helps DBAs to observe transaction locking conditions and troubleshoot deadlock problems.

When memory pressure exceeds the allocated quota, it spills data to disk, allowing queries to complete even when memory limits are reached. This feature is demonstrated in scenarios where operators like HashAgg use up to 600MB of disk space.\\n\\nAdditionally, tidb-server can be started with the --advertise-address parameter and typically undergoes upgrades using a rolling upgrade method.

       "    'text': '# TiDB 5.3 Release Notes\\n\\n## Improvements\\n\\n+ TiDB\\n\\n    - Show the affected SQL statements in the debug log when the coprocessor encounters a lock, which is helpful in diagnosing problems [#27718](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/27718)\\n    - Support showing the size of the backup and restore data when backing up and restoring data in the SQL logical layer [#27247](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/27247)\\n    - Improve the default collection logic of ANALYZE when `tidb_analyze_version` is `2`, which accelerates collection and reduces resource overhead\\n    - Introduce the `ANALYZE TABLE table_name COLUMNS col_1, col_2, ... , col_n` syntax. The syntax allows collecting statistics only on a portion of the columns in wide tables, which improves the speed of statistics collection\\n\\n+ TiKV\\n\\n    - Enhance disk space protection to improve storage stability\\n\\n        To solve the issue that TiKV might panic in case of a disk fully-written error, TiKV introduces a two-level threshold defense mechanism to protect the disk remaining space from being exhausted by excess traffic. Additionally, the mechanism provides the ability to reclaim space when the threshold is triggered. When the remaining space threshold is triggered, some write operations will fail and TiKV will return a disk full error as well as a list of disk full nodes. In this case, to recover the space and restore the service, you can execute `Drop/Truncate Table` or scale out the nodes.\\n\\n    - Simplify the algorithm of L0 flow control [#10879](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/10879)\\n    - Improve the error log report in the raft client module [#10944](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/pull/10944)\\n    - Improve logging threads to avoid them becoming a performance bottleneck [#10841](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/10841)\\n    - Add more statistics types of write queries [#10507](https://github.com/tikv/tikv/issues/10507)\\n    - Reduce the write latency by separating I/O operations from Raftstore thread pool (disabled by default).

       "    'text': '# TiDB 7.3.0 Release Notes\\n\\n## Compatibility changes\\n\\n> **Note:**\\n>\\n> This section provides compatibility changes you need to know when you upgrade from v7.2.0 to the current version (v7.3.0). If you are upgrading from v7.1.0 or earlier versions to the current version, you might also need to check the compatibility changes introduced in intermediate versions.\\n\\n### Behavior changes\\n\\n* TiDB\\n\\n    - MPP is a distributed computing framework provided by the TiFlash engine, which allows data exchange between nodes and provides high-performance, high-throughput SQL algorithms. Compared with other protocols, the MPP protocol is more mature and can provide better task and resource management. Starting from v7.3.0, when TiDB pushes computation tasks to TiFlash, the optimizer only generates execution plans using the MPP protocol by default. If [`tidb_allow_mpp`](/system-variables.md#tidb_allow_mpp-new-in-v50) is set to `OFF`, queries might return errors after you upgrade TiDB. It is recommended that you check the value of `tidb_allow_mpp` and set it to `ON` before the upgrade. If you still need the optimizer to choose one of the Cop, BatchCop, and MPP protocols for generating execution plans based on cost estimates, you can set the [`tidb_allow_tiflash_cop`](/system-variables.md#tidb_allow_tiflash_cop-new-in-v730) variable to `ON`.\\n\\n* Backup & Restore (BR)\\n\\n    - BR adds an empty cluster check before performing a full data restoration. By default, restoring data to a non-empty cluster is not allowed. If you want to force the restoration, you can use the `--filter` option to specify the corresponding table name to restore data to.\\n\\n* TiDB Lightning\\n\\n    - `tikv-importer.on-duplicate` is deprecated and replaced by [`conflict.strategy`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task).\\n    - The `max-error` parameter, which controls the maximum number of non-fatal errors that TiDB Lightning can tolerate before stopping the migration task, no longer limits import data conflicts. The [`conflict.threshold`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) parameter now controls the maximum number of conflicting records that can be tolerated.\\n\\n* TiCDC\\n\\n    - When Kafka sink uses Avro protocol, if the `force-replicate` parameter is set to `true`, TiCDC reports an error when creating a changefeed.\\n    - Due to incompatibility between `delete-only-output-handle-key-columns` and `force-replicate` parameters, when both parameters are enabled, TiCDC reports an error when creating a changefeed.\\n    - When the output protocol is Open Protocol, the `UPDATE` events only output the changed columns.\\n\\n### System variables\\n\\n| Variable name | Change type | Description |\\n|--------|------------------------------|------|\\n| [`tidb_opt_enable_mpp_shared_cte_execution`](/system-variables.md#tidb_opt_enable_mpp_shared_cte_execution-new-in-v720) | Modified | This system variable takes effect starting from v7.3.0. It controls whether non-recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) can be executed in TiFlash MPP. |\\n| [`tidb_allow_tiflash_cop`](/system-variables.md#tidb_allow_tiflash_cop-new-in-v730) | Newly added | This system variable is used to select the protocol for generating execution plans when TiDB pushes computation tasks down to TiFlash. |\\n| [`tidb_lock_unchanged_keys`](/system-variables.md#tidb_lock_unchanged_keys-new-in-v711-and-v730) | Newly added | This variable is used to control in certain scenarios whether to lock the keys that are involved but not modified in a transaction. |\\n| [`tidb_opt_enable_non_eval_scalar_subquery`](/system-variables.md#tidb_opt_enable_non_eval_scalar_subquery-new-in-v730) | Newly added | Controls whether the `EXPLAIN` statement disables the execution of constant subqueries that can be expanded at the optimization stage.  |\\n| [`tidb_skip_missing_partition_stats`](/system-variables.md#tidb_skip_missing_partition_stats-new-in-v730) | Newly added | This variable controls the generation of GlobalStats when partition statistics are missing. |\\n| [`tiflash_replica_read`](/system-variables.md#tiflash_replica_read-new-in-v730) | Newly added | Controls the strategy for selecting TiFlash replicas when a query requires the TiFlash engine. |',\n",

Additionally, the mechanism provides the ability to reclaim space when the threshold is triggered. When the remaining space threshold is triggered, some write operations will fail and TiKV will return a disk full error as well as a list of disk full nodes.

       "    'text': '# TiDB 7.3.0 Release Notes\\n\\n## Compatibility changes\\n\\n> **Note:**\\n>\\n> This section provides compatibility changes you need to know when you upgrade from v7.2.0 to the current version (v7.3.0). If you are upgrading from v7.1.0 or earlier versions to the current version, you might also need to check the compatibility changes introduced in intermediate versions.\\n\\n### Behavior changes\\n\\n* TiDB\\n\\n    - MPP is a distributed computing framework provided by the TiFlash engine, which allows data exchange between nodes and provides high-performance, high-throughput SQL algorithms. Compared with other protocols, the MPP protocol is more mature and can provide better task and resource management. Starting from v7.3.0, when TiDB pushes computation tasks to TiFlash, the optimizer only generates execution plans using the MPP protocol by default. If [`tidb_allow_mpp`](/system-variables.md#tidb_allow_mpp-new-in-v50) is set to `OFF`, queries might return errors after you upgrade TiDB. It is recommended that you check the value of `tidb_allow_mpp` and set it to `ON` before the upgrade. If you still need the optimizer to choose one of the Cop, BatchCop, and MPP protocols for generating execution plans based on cost estimates, you can set the [`tidb_allow_tiflash_cop`](/system-variables.md#tidb_allow_tiflash_cop-new-in-v730) variable to `ON`.\\n\\n* Backup & Restore (BR)\\n\\n    - BR adds an empty cluster check before performing a full data restoration. By default, restoring data to a non-empty cluster is not allowed. If you want to force the restoration, you can use the `--filter` option to specify the corresponding table name to restore data to.\\n\\n* TiDB Lightning\\n\\n    - `tikv-importer.on-duplicate` is deprecated and replaced by [`conflict.strategy`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task).\\n    - The `max-error` parameter, which controls the maximum number of non-fatal errors that TiDB Lightning can tolerate before stopping the migration task, no longer limits import data conflicts. The [`conflict.threshold`](/tidb-lightning/tidb-lightning-configuration.md#tidb-lightning-task) parameter now controls the maximum number of conflicting records that can be tolerated.\\n\\n* TiCDC\\n\\n    - When Kafka sink uses Avro protocol, if the `force-replicate` parameter is set to `true`, TiCDC reports an error when creating a changefeed.\\n    - Due to incompatibility between `delete-only-output-handle-key-columns` and `force-replicate` parameters, when both parameters are enabled, TiCDC reports an error when creating a changefeed.\\n    - When the output protocol is Open Protocol, the `UPDATE` events only output the changed columns.\\n\\n### System variables\\n\\n| Variable name | Change type | Description |\\n|--------|------------------------------|------|\\n| [`tidb_opt_enable_mpp_shared_cte_execution`](/system-variables.md#tidb_opt_enable_mpp_shared_cte_execution-new-in-v720) | Modified | This system variable takes effect starting from v7.3.0.

It offers features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), conversion of `IN` and `= ANY` subqueries to semi joins and left outer semi joins, respectively, and optimization of null-aware semi joins in the `WHERE` clause by converting them into inner joins and aggregates. TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\\n\\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions. While supporting most MySQL built-in functions, there are some exceptions. Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\\n\\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\\n\\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\\n\\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\\n\\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability.

They can be managed using administrative commands such as ADMIN CANCEL DDL, ADMIN SHOW DDL JOBS, ADMIN PAUSE DDL, and ADMIN RESUME DDL. While generally online and not blocking concurrent Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations, certain operations like adding indexes may require backfilling data. DDL operations can impact replication performance, especially when multiple table renames occur in the same statement or during cluster upgrades.

Performance improvements include features like `tidb_ opt_ distinct_ agg_ push_ down`, and resource management capabilities such as a default resource group with unlimited resources, prioritizing allocation based on priority and RU_PER_SEC in overcapacity scenarios. Runtime information for resource control metrics is collected and visualized in Grafana's TiDB > Resource Control dashboard.\\n\\nTiDB supports deployment options like TiDB Self-Managed and TiDB Cloud, uses PD Client to batch TSO requests, and interacts with key tables related to TTL metrics. It is monitored and diagnosed by the Performance Overview Dashboard, supporting various data types, including numeric types. Recursive CTEs are handled with warnings when data length exceeds the seed part in strict mode, determining their data type from the seed part, allowing combinations of `UNION` and `UNION ALL`, and reporting errors for problematic definitions even if not referenced. These features were updated to version v4.0.4.\\n\\nTiDB integrates with components like TiKV for storage, TiFlash for analytics, and TiCDC for data replication, offering tools such as BR for backup/restore and Dumpling/Sqldump for migration. It provides partition pruning, optimizer hints, GBK character set support, memory control through `tidb_ mem_ quota_ query`, and handles specific transaction errors like `ErrWriteConflict` and `ErrTxnRetryable`. Prometheus is used for centralized metrics collection.\\n\\nTiDB interacts with the PD (Placement Driver) component to obtain timestamps (TSOs) and manage cluster tasks. It provides statement summary tables similar to MySQL's `events_ statements_ summary_ by_ digest` starting from v4.0.0-rc.1, also available in `information_schema`. TiDB interprets date and time literals in various formats, including 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YY-MM-DD', 'YYYYMMDDHHMMSS' or 'YYMMDDHHMMSS', and YYYYMMDDHHMMSS or YYMMDDHHMMSS, attempting to match MySQL's behavior for incorrectly formatted values. It does not support modifying the length of decimal fields, resulting in an error: `ERROR 1105 (HY000): unsupported modify decimal column precision`. The default value of the system variable `tidb_ analyze_ version` was changed from `2` to `1`.\\n\\nAdditionally, TiDB is built for cloud-native applications and supports horizontal scalability. Key features include:\\n1. **DDL Job Output**: The `admin show ddl jobs` statement now includes schema and table names in its output.\\n2. **Configuration Warnings**: TiDB prints warning logs for unrecognized configuration options.\\n3. **Process Termination**: The `KILL TIDB` command can be used to terminate TiDB server processes.\\n4. **Query Execution State**: The 'State' column in the output of `SHOW PROCESSLIST` may appear non-descriptive due to parallel query execution.\"},\n",

       "     'description': \"TiDB is a distributed SQL database designed for MySQL compatibility, supporting large-cale data with high availability and strong consistency. It offers features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), conversion of `IN` and `= ANY` subqueries to semi joins and left outer semi joins, respectively, and optimization of null-aware semi joins in the `WHERE` clause by converting them into inner joins and aggregates. TiDB handles non-sargable predicates by scanning all partitions of a table when subquery decorrelation is disabled and supports MySQL-compatible foreign key constraints. It can be deployed in an IPv6 environment and efficiently imports data using TiDB Lightning or the `IMPORT INTO ... FROM SELECT` syntax. However, it currently does not support the Cube syntax.\\n\\nTiDB supports all cast functions and operators available in MySQL 5.7, with a specific difference in handling double-precision floating-point numbers in scientific notation when casting to CHAR, always displaying the complete numeric value. It provides various aggregate functions, including COUNT, executing them with the DISTINCT option by default and offering the `SHOW BUILTINS` command to list available functions.
